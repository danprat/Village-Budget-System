    Update CHANGELOG.md :   
        Add a detailed entry for every change (new features, fixes, etc.) in the CHANGELOG.md file.  
        Include the commit ID and a direct link to the GitHub commit.
         

    Commit with a Detailed Message :   
        Write a clear and descriptive commit message explaining the change, its purpose, and any related issues.
         

    Push to GitHub :   
        Push the changes to the repository and tag the commit if itâ€™s a new release.
         

    Log Commit ID :
